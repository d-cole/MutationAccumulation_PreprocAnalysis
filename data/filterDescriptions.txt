Filtering for SNP detection

Filtering abbreviation meanings:

f0: 
 - Remove sites with 'LowQual' tag present
 - ignore sites where missing sample info
 - All sites must have 1 GT different and 13 the same
 - For CC3-3 if the odd GT is CC3-3M the site is removed
 - This was used to calculate median DP for individual samples

f1:
 - f0 + added individual DP filtering
 - For a site to pass:
    2/3 of individuals must pass individual median DP filter
    To pass DP filter must be in range 0.5*MedDP < x < 1.5*MedDP
    Mutant sample had to pass individual DP filter

f2:
 - f1 + remove TE regions
 - removed sites that were inside the ranges specified by:
    Spolyrhiza_290_v2.repeatmasked_assembly_v1_TE_intervals.txt
    TE_intervals_jan2015_no_plastids_sorted

f3:
 - f2 + merged with ancestor
 - For sites where ancestor was present added ancestor sample at end of samples
    format: <GT:AD:DP>:REF/ALT
 - For sites where ancestor was not present added "."

f4:
 - f3 + removed sites common between both genotypes
 - Compared CC3-3_f3.vcf and GP2-3_f3.vcf and noted common sites
    - These are sites common to both genotypes after the f3 filtering

f5:
 - f4 + removed sites where cohort was 0/1

f6:
 - f5 + remove sites on pseudo0

f7:
 - f6 + removed all sites where 'mutant' had GQ < 20

f8:
 - removed all sites where mutant was not 0/1 and cohort was not 0/0
