GP2-3 Filter descriptions

rf0:
 - Calculated median DP for individual samples
 - No filtering output from Unified genotyper ~128,000,000 bp

rf1:
 - rf0 + 
 - Remove sites with 'LowQual' tag present
 - Removal of sites on pseudo0
 - Filtering for ALT sites
    
rf2:
 - rf1 + 
 - Filter for sites having 1 GT 0/1, 13 GT 0/0
 - Filtering on individual sample depth calculated from rf0
    - 2/3 of samples must pass individual depth filters
 - Mutant must pass individual depth filters and have GQ > 20
 - Ignoring sites where missing sample data


rf3:
 - rf2 +
 - Removal of TE regions

rf4:
 - rf4 + 
 - Binomial filter
 - No more than 2% frequency of focal sample alternate base reads in other samples

rf5:
 - rf4 +  
 - Removed sites that did not pass 50bp filter( >= 99% of reads are reference
        across the 50bp window)

rf6:
 - rf5 + 
 - No more than 1% frequency of focal sample alt base in other samples

rf7:
 - rf6 + 
 - requires 7 alternate reads present in mutant sample
     - based on uneven P-value dist. from binomial test
