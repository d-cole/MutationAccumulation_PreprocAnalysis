This folder contains directories for candidate mutations between CC3-3 lines.
The candidate sites are organized by the GT of the odd site out of the 14.

In the case where the candidate site had one sample with GT 01 and thirteen with GT 11, information about sites like this will be in the folder one01rest11.
